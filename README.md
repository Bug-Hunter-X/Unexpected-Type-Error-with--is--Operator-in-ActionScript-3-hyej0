This repository demonstrates a common, yet easily overlooked, error in ActionScript 3 related to type checking using the 'is' operator.  The 'is' operator returns false if the checked object is null or undefined, even if its type would otherwise match.  This can lead to unexpected runtime errors when a method or property access on a potentially null object is attempted within the 'if' condition's body.  The solution highlights the correct way to handle potential null or undefined values to prevent such errors.
